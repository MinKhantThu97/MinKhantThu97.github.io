                    Vintage car is a car which were built between the time period of 1919 and 1930. Some consider the time period to be 1919 to 1925. However, unlike antique cars and classic cars, the vintage cars do not lose their value in case they are modified

                <h2>When does a car become a classic?</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                  The Classic Car Club of America defines a classic as a “fine” or “distinctive” automobile built between 1915 and 1948.
                  For insurance and registration purposes, the age of a classic car, in most cases, is at least 20 years old but not more than 40 years old.
                  In short, any car that's aged 40 years or older is considered to be a classic car, or in official terms, a 'historic vehicle'
